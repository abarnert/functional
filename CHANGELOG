* v0.7.0 -- target release date: 2006-07-29
    + Add functional.map() and functional.filter(), versions of the
        similarly-named builtins with sane semantics.
    + Fix several reference counting-related bugs.
    + The C version now works with Python 2.3

### Anything above here is a roadmap
### Anything below here is the actual changelog

* v0.6 -- released: 2006-04-27
    + Various sundry performance enhancements for the C version
    + flip will now reverse all non-keyword arguments, as opposed to simply
        reversing the first two as it did in 0.5.
    + compose now features an optional unpack parameter.
        compose(f, g, unpack=True)  == f(*g(...))
        compose(f, g, unpack=False) == f(g(...))

        flip
